# super-user-agent-list-generator.sh
A way to generate big lists of common desktop user agents. The main goal being user agent spoofing

Simply run `generate.sh` to generate the `user-agents.txt` and `oscpu.txt` files.

See `extra-sources-templates.sh` to add more sources

I also added the most popular accept headers in the `accept-headers.txt` file, but those are not generated automatically, even if generate.sh takes care of them.
